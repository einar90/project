%% Using Peacemann Well Models
%
% In this example we will demonstrate how our two-point solver can be
% equipped with a Peacemann type well model. For a vertical well, the model
% is on the following form
%
% $$ q = J (p \textbf{--} p_{bh}), \qquad
%    J=\frac{2\pi K h}{\mu (\ln(r_e/r_w)+s)},\quad
%    r_e = 0.2\sqrt{\Delta x\Delta y} $$
%
% where *q* is the flow rate *p_{bh}* is the bottom-hole pressure, *r_e* is
% the effective (Peacemann) radius, *r_w* is the radius of the well, *K* is
% the permeability, and *h* the height of the well. Depending upon what is
% specified, either the bottom-hole pressure *p_bh* or the flow rate *q*
% end up as extra unknowns per completion in the resulting linear system.
%
% To demonstrate the use of well models, we will (as before) solve the
% single-phase pressure equation
%
% $$\nabla\cdot v = q, \qquad v=\textbf{--}\frac{K}{\mu}\nabla p,$$
%
% for a Cartesian grid and isotropic, homogeneous permeability. See the
% <simpleBC.html basic flow-solver tutorial> for more details
% on the grid structure, the structure used to hold the solutions, etc.


%% Define grid, rock and fluid data
% Construct a Cartesian grid of size 20-by-20-by-5 cells, where each cell
% has dimension 1-by-1-by-1. Set permeability equal 100 mD, and use the
% default single fluid with density 1000 kg/m^3 and viscosity 1 cP.
nx = 20; ny = 20; nz = 5;
G = cartGrid([nx, ny, nz]);
G = computeGeometry(G, 'Verbose', true);
rock.perm = repmat(100 .* milli*darcy, [G.cells.num, 1]);
fluid     = initSingleFluid('mu' ,    1*centi*poise     , ...
                            'rho', 1014*kilogram/meter^3);
T = computeTrans(G, rock, 'Verbose', true);

%% Introduce wells
% We will include two wells, one rate-controlled vertical well and one
% horizontal well controlled by bottom-hole pressure. Wells are described
% using a Peacemann model, giving an extra set of equations that need to be
% assembled.
%
% The first well is vertical well (vertical is default):
%
% * completion in cells: cellsWell1
% * controlled by injection rate = 1.0  [m^3/d]
% * radius = 0.1.                       [m]
%
cellsWell1 =  1 : nx*ny : nx*ny*nz;
radius     = .1;
W = addWell([], G, rock, cellsWell1, 'Type', 'rate', ...
            'Val', 1.0/day(), 'Radius', radius, 'name', 'I');
disp('Well #1: '); display(W(1));

%%
% The second well is horizontal in the 'y' direction:
%
% * completion in cells: cellsWell2
% * controlled by bottom hole pressure, bhp = 1e5 [Pa]
% * radius = 0.1                                  [m]
%
cellsWell2 = nx : ny : nx*ny;
W = addWell(W, G, rock, cellsWell2, 'Type', 'bhp', ...
            'Val', 1.0e5, 'Radius', radius, 'Dir', 'y', 'name', 'P');
disp('Well #2: '); display(W(2));

%%
% We plot the wells to check if the wells are placed as we wanted them.
% (The plot will later be moved to subplot(2,2,1), hence we first find the
% corresponding axes position before generating the handle graphics).
subplot(2,2,1), pos = get(gca,'Position'); clf
   plotGrid(G, 'FaceColor', 'none');
   view(3), camproj perspective, axis tight off, camlight headlight
   [ht, htxt, hs] = plotWell(G, W, 'radius', radius, 'height', 2);
   set(htxt, 'FontSize', 16);

%%
% Once the wells are added, we can generate the components of the linear
% system corresponding to the two wells and initialize the solution
% structure (with correct bhp)
resSol = initState(G, W, 0);
display(resSol.wellSol);


%% Solve linear system
% Solve linear system construced from S and W to obtain solution for flow
% and pressure in the reservoir and the wells.
gravity off
resSol = incompTPFA(resSol, G, T, fluid, 'wells', W);

%% Report results
% We move the plot of the grids and wells to the upper-left subplot. The
% producer inflow profile is shown in the upper-right and the cell
% pressures in the lower-left subplot. In the lower-right subplot, we show
% the flux intensity, which must be constructed by averaging over cell
% faces (this is what is achieved by 'rldecode' and 'accumarray')

%subplot(2,2,1)
   set(gca, 'Position', pos);  % move the current plot

subplot(2,2,2)
   plot(convertTo(-resSol.wellSol(2).flux, meter^3/day))
   title('Producer inflow profile [m^3/d]');

subplot(2,2,3)
   plotCellData(G, convertTo(resSol.pressure(1:G.cells.num), barsa));

   cellNo = rldecode(1:G.cells.num, diff(G.cells.facePos), 2) .';
   cf     = accumarray(cellNo, abs(resSol.flux(G.cells.faces(:,1))) );
   plotCellData(G, convertTo(cf, meter^3/day) );
