\begin{itemize}
    \item Single phase flow into a single well.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Well-block pressure is essentially equal to the actual flowing pressure at $r=0.2 \Delta x$.
        \item We can then calculate the flowing bottom-hole pressure using the equation for steady-state, radial flow.
    \end{itemize}

\label{sec:introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The horizontal dimensions of a grid block containing a well are inevitably much larger than the well it contains.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This means that the pressure calculated for a well block will be greatly different from the flowing bottom-hole pressure.
    \end{itemize}
