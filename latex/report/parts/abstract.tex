\begin{abstract}
In reservoir simulation, a number of differential equations are used to describe a system. For practical applications, we need to create discrete, numerical models for these systems. The numerical models include the concept of a well model to account for the flow from the reservoir into a well. This report presents Peaceman's well model, including the concepts of a well index and equivalent wellbore radius.

Peaceman's derivation of the value for the well index for single-phase flow in two dimensions performed using both a numerical solver for the differential flow equation and simulated pressure distributions from the ECL100 and MRST reservoir simulators.

A perfect fit with Peaceman's results was achieved using the pressure distribution acquired from numerical solution of the differential flow equation.

Recreating Peaceman's results using the simulated pressure distributions proved problematic due to the inability to place the wells in the corner of the wellblocks, as done by Peaceman. A model approximating corner-placed wells was created by refining the grid in the corners and calculating a new averaged wellblock pressure. A good fit with Peaceman's results was then achieved.
