\subsection{Numerical Solution Of The Diffusivity Equation} % (fold)
\label{sub:numerical_solution_of_the_diffusivity_equation}
The solver for the discrete diffusivity equation was implemented in Python\footnote{\emph{Python} is a general purpose, high-level, open source programming language.} using the NumPy\footnote{\emph{NumPy} is a package for scientific computing with Python. It provides N-dimensional arrays and linear algebra tools/solvers similar to Matlab.} library. The implementation is shown in Appendix~\ref{sub:numerical_solver_for_the_steady_state_pressure_distribution_using_repeated_five_spot_pattern}.

The post-processing of the calculated pressures, including approximate calculation of equivalent wellbore radius as outlined in Section~\ref{ssub:approximate_calculation_of_equivalent_radius} and exact calculation of equivalent wellbore radius as outlined in Section~\ref{ssub:exact_calculation_of_equivalent_radius} was also implemented in Python. The implementation is shown in Appendix~\ref{ssub:postprocessing_of_peaceman_results}.

\subsubsection{Implementation} % (fold)
\label{ssub:implementation}
What follows is a short step-by-step description of the program flow of the discrete diffusivity equation solver program. The equation solved is outlined is outlined in Section~\ref{ssub:derivation}.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Set $M$-value (i.e. grid size) to solve the system for.
    \item Initialize $A$ and $\delta$ matrices. Sizes are, respectively, $(M+1)^2 \times (M+1)^2$ and $(M+1)^2$. The matrices are zero-filled.
    \item Create a representation of the general $A$ matrix generated by applying a five-spot pattern to a two-dimensional surface. The equation for each point is represented by a set of 5 tuples, each representing one term in equation \eqref{eq:differential-flow-discretzed-dimensionless}.
    \item Apply boundary conditions to the matrix created in the previous step by manipulating the set of tuples at each point.
    \item Generate the actual $A$ matrix to be used for solving equation \eqref{eq:equation-system-matrix} by counting the occurrences of each unique tuple $(i,j)$ at each point.
    \item Populate the $\delta$ vector by setting $\delta_{0,0}=1,\delta_{M,M}=-1$.
    \item Calculate the pressure distribution by calling a linear equation set solver with the $A$ and $\delta$ matrices as parameters.
    \item Save the pressure distribution to a text file.

\subsection{Pressure Distribution From Numerical Reservoir Simulation Software} % (fold)
\label{sub:using_pressure_distribution_from_numerical_reservoir_simulation_software}

\subsubsection{Issues} % (fold)
\label{ssub:issues_and_approximations}
Acquiring a pressure distribution suitable for calculating $r_{eq}$ using the methods outlined in Sections~\ref{ssub:approximate_calculation_of_equivalent_radius} and \ref{ssub:exact_calculation_of_equivalent_radius} posed some issues.

Firstly, Peaceman's wells are, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:well-placement-paper}, effectively placed in the corners of the corner-blocks. This is, however, not possible in the ECL100 and MRST reservoir simulators and has to be approximated using grid refinement and post-processing of the pressure data.

The second issue is that the exact approach outlined in Section~\ref{ssub:exact_calculation_of_equivalent_radius} is derived specifically for pressure distributions calculated by applying the five-spot pattern to the two-dimensional diffusivity equation on a uniform square grid. Because it relies exclusively on the well block pressures it is also much more sensitive to any approximations made. Due to this it will not yield results anywhere close to the correct value for $r_{eq}$ when using the pressure distribution from simulators.

\subsubsection{Approximating The Well Placement} % (fold)
\label{ssub:approximating_the_well_placement}

\paragraph{Grid Refinement And Averaged Well Block Pressure} % (fold)
\label{par:grid_refinement_and_averaged_well_block_pressure}
To approximate Peaceman's well placement, the grid was refined in the corners as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:well-placement-approximation}. The wells were placed at the center of a small block of size $\frac{1}{8}\Delta x\times \frac{1}{8}\Delta x$ in each corner. This results in a pressure distribution very similar to the one resulting from the numerical solution of the diffusivity equation outlined in Section~\ref{ssub:derivation}. However, the pressures in the new, smaller wellbocks are not equivalent to that of the well blocks in Peaceman's model. Therefore a new \emph{averaged well block pressure}, $\bar{p}$ is defined. It is calculated from the smaller blocks refined from the original well block:
\begin{equation}
    \bar{p}_{0,0} = \mathrm{avg}\left[ p_{0,0}, p_{1,0}, p_{0,1}, p_{1,1} \right]
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \bar{p}_{M,M} = \mathrm{avg}\left[ p_{M,M}, p_{M-1,M}, p_{M,M-1}, p_{M-1,M-1} \right].
\end{equation}
\nomenclature{$\mathrm{avg}$}{averaging operator}
\nomenclature{$\bar{p}_{i,i}$}{averaged well block pressure}
The coordinates used are indicated in Figure~\ref{fig:well-placement-approximation}. Note that using this formulation the simulated well block pressures (i.e. $p_{0,0}$ and $p_{M,M}$) and the pressure in the larger blocks (e.g. $p_{1,1}$ and $p_{M-1,M-1}$) are given equal influence of the resulting averaged well block pressure, despite them not occupying as large an area.  This approach yields results far closer Peaceman's results than if an area-weighted average is used.

\paragraph{Radius Approximation} % (fold)
\label{par:radius_approximation}
Using the proposed averaged well block pressure poses some issues concerning the radius matrix used in the post-processing calculations. This is handled by assuming that the averaged well block pressures are located \emph{exactly} in the corner (which they are not). With this assumption the calculations are very straight-forward, but it introduces an error term. 
% paragraph radius_approximation (end)

\paragraph{Magnitude Of Error In Radius Approximation} % (fold)
\label{par:error_in_radius_approximation}
We take the actual radial position of the averaged well block pressure, i.e. the deviation from the assumed position in the corner, to be the average of the distance from the corner to the center of blocks $(0,0)$ and $(1,1)$ in Figure~\ref{fig:well-placement-approximation}. This is the error term $e$ introduced by that the well is placed in the corner:
\begin{equation}
    e = \sqrt{2\times \left( \frac{1/8+3/8}{2}\Delta x \right)^2} = \frac{1}{4}\sqrt{2}\Delta x
\end{equation}

Because $e$ is quite large for blocks near the corner (35\% for block $(2,2)$), the  blocks nearest to the averaged well blocks are ignored. All blocks on rows and columns 0 and 1 were also dropped due to radius and averaging concerns. The ignored blocks are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:blocks-used}.

\subsubsection{Simulation Specification} % (fold)
\label{ssub:simulation_specification}
Except for the initial pressure and bottom-hole pressure control settings, the same parameters were used in both simulators and for all grid sizes. The relevant parameters are listed in Table~\ref{tbl:simulation-parameters}. The grids were structured as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:well-placement-approximation}. The full specifications for the ECL100 and MRST simulations are shown in Appendix~\ref{sec:ecl100_simulation_specifications}.

Note that the ECL100 model has a quite high initial pressure, while the MRST model is initialized to 0 bar(g). This was done on purpose to highlight calculation errors between the models while developing the post-processing script.
