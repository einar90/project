\label{sec:introduction}
In reservoir simulation, a number of differential equations are used to describe the flow of fluids. These equations can only be solved analytically for very simple systems involving homogenous reservoirs with regular boundaries \cite{Peaceman1977Fundamentals}. Because of this, we need to create discrete models for the reservoir and solve the flow equations numerically.

The reservoir is discretized by dividing it into \emph{grid blocks}. Each block has a set of properties (porosity, permeability, saturations) etc., descirbing the corresponding area of the reservoir.
