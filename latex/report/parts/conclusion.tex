\section{Conclusions} % (fold)
\label{sec:conclusions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The $r_{eq}$ values calculated using the numerical solution of the diffusivity equation match the results in Peaceman's paper \cite{Peaceman1978Interpretation} perfectly for the number of decimals shown in the paper.
    \item A good fit with Peaceman's regression results were achieved when using simulated pressures from the MRST and ECL100 reservoir simulators with models approximating Peaceman's grid.
    \item Peaceman's exact method for calculating the equivalent wellbore radius is not applicable to pressure distributions simulated using ECL100 and MRST.
