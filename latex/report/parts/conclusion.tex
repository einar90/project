\label{sec:conclusions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The $r_{eq}$ values calculated using the numerical solution of the diffusivity equation match the results in Peaceman's paper \cite{Peaceman1978Interpretation} perfectly for the number of decimals shown in the paper.
    \item A good fit with Peaceman's regression results were achieved when using simulated pressures from the MRST and ECL100 reservoir simulators with models approximating Peaceman's grid.
